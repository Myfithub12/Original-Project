A simplified bio about my life. Each html is just a snippet of my life.

In this project I wanted to present a little about myself, and in doing so I was able to include a navigation menu, or hamburger menu, for small screens like mobile devices and tablets. I also included flexbox to rescue the size of the screen itself. I added some bootstrap to help with some of the coloring of the site. With JavaScript I created a link on Collections.html so that when a person highlights one of the game console buttons, the image will pop up. I also linked documents on Collections.html. On my About.html page, I set up some rows and columns. With these I can separate were I lived into rows, and with columns I have a little info from my life in between pictures. Although this is just a project, I can take what I learned here and use it as a stepping stone towards all future projects.
