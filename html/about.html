                    <p>I was born in St. Charles in 09/1977. Eventually my famliy moved to St. Peters in 1980 and stayed
                        there until 1986.

                <h1>Illinois (1986-1991)</h1>
                <p>In 1986 we move to Carterville with a population of around 5000 people in the town. Carterville is
                    about
                    halfway between Marion, off I-57, and Carbondale. Carbondale had and still has Southern Ilinois
                    University, SIU. During my time in Carterville my dad and I went to alot of SIU football and
                    basketball
                    games. In 1991 we moved to Kentucky.

                <p>In 1991 we moved to Louisville where we remain today, sort of. Like everyone else, we are slowly
                    moving
                    farther away from each other. My older sister and her husband live in North Carolina. I started high
                    school and went to college here in Louisville. While living here I have gone to multiple University
